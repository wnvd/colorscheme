## dev installation

to customize and build this theme you will need [lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim) and [shipwright](https://github.com/rktjmp/shipwright.nvim)

using `lazy`

```lua
{
  "xero/miasma.nvim",
  branch = "dev",
  dependencies = {
    "rktjmp/lush.nvim",
    "rktjmp/shipwright.nvim",
  },
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  config = function()
    vim.cmd("colorscheme miasma")
  end,
},
```

## customization

this theme is built with `lush.nvim`, so customizationis are quite easy.

open `lua/lush_theme/miasma.lua` and execute `:Lushify`. then adjust colors to suit your taste with real-time feedback. for the best experience, i suggest disabling LSP and enabeling a colorizer like [nvim-highlight-colors](https://github.com/brenoprata10/nvim-highlight-colors) or [NvChad-colorizer](https://github.com/NvChad/nvim-colorizer.lua).

lots more details on using `lush` in their repo: [rktjmp/lush.nvim](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim).

## building

lush is cool and all, but loading the raw lua theme version takes 25+ ms...

**ermergerd mah startup time!!1!#@~**

so i suggest exporting it as a classic vim colorscheme. simply run the
`build.sh` script in the root directory and `color/miasma.vim` will be
`{cre,upd}ated`. more info in the [lush without lush guide](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim/blob/main/BUILD.md).
